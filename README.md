# README

Thanks for this cool task with some tricky traps.
I had a lot of fun - but we will talk about later :D

## Requirements
* Node v12.9.0
* NPM 6.10.2

NVM (Node Version Manager) will help you to setup the 
correct node-version for every project.

## How to setup this project
```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

Now the webpack-dev-server will start on 
port 24284 (my birthday :P).

Have fun and I hope you will like my code.

## How to build this project
```
> npm run build
``` 

This command will build this project in a structured dist-folder
